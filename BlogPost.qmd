## 2. Impact of GPA

Does GPA affect salary, and does it depend on major? The evidence suggests that GPA does matter for salary but not equally across all majors. When we allow the GPA–salary relationship to differ by major, the model fits the data better than a one-size-fits-all approach, showing that the impact of GPA genuinely varies by field of study. In particular, GPA appears to matter more in majors such as Business, Engineering, Industrial Arts, Law & Public Policy, Social Sciences, Psychology & Social Work, and Communications, where a one-point increase in GPA is linked to substantially higher earnings compared to the reference major, often on the order of \$9,000 to \$13,000 more per year, with reasonably precise ranges around those estimates. In contrast, for majors like Arts, Biology, Computers & Mathematics, Interdisciplinary studies, and Humanities, the differences are smaller and less certain, suggesting GPA plays a weaker role in shaping salaries in those fields. Overall, this pattern indicates that students should consider their major when thinking about grades: GPA clearly matters more in some careers than others, and while strong academic performance can pay off, especially in certain majors, being overly anxious about grades is unlikely to be necessary across the board.

## 3. Salaries Across Majors

-   **Differences in salary by major:**\
    {{State whether your dataset shows significant salary differences among majors.}}

-   **High‑Earning Majors:**\
    {{List or describe which majors appear to earn the highest salaries based on your data.}}

    There is a difference in salary for different majors. We found that the average salary 5 years after graduating is highest for **Engineering, Computers and Mathematics, and Physical Sciences.**

    {{Summarize your findings about salary differences between men and women in the same major category.}}
-   **Variation by Major Category:**\
    {{Explain whether the magnitude of the gender pay gap changes depending on the major.}}
-   **Example Using Your Group’s Major:**\
    {{Provide a specific example comparing men’s vs. women’s salaries for your chosen major category. Include numbers, visuals, or tables if needed.}}

## 5. Other Factors — The Value of a College Education

### Problem Background

-   **Predictors of Salary:**\
    {{Describe how well your dataset’s existing variables explain or predict salary outcomes.}}

-   **Missing or Additional Variables:**\
    {{List important factors not included in the dataset that likely influence salary (e.g., internships, geographic location, work experience).}}

-   **Specific Example Demonstrating Prediction Quality:**\
    {{Walk through one specific example that illustrates how well—or poorly—your model or variables predict salary.}}

    Our model will predict the salary of a person, and on average be off by about \$5700. We currently are using a person's Major, GPA, and sex to predict their salary. There are other variables that would potentially help us to better predict salary, including but not limited to times changing industries, continued eduction (i.e. a Master's Program), and geographic locations. All of these are factors that partially determine a salary. Another potential determinant is how much they liked their major, as a person who likes their work is more likely to perform well and get raises. To give an example of our predicition compared to the true salaries, we randomly selected a person from the dataset, and predicted their salary. We predicted a salary of "\$XXXX", and they had a salary of XXXX dollars. So we were off by XXXX dollars.
